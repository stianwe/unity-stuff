SliderAnimator
===========

A simple script without any dependencies which lets you animate a Unity Slider.

Instructions:<br/>
1. Download SliderAnimator.cs and import it into your Unity project.<br/>
2. Attach it to the Slider object which you want to animate.<br/>
3. Call the script's Animate() function with the start and end values for the animation. You can also specify if you want the slider to increment or decrement.<br/>
4. (Optional) If you want to execute some code when the slider wraps around or ends animating, you can simply set the OnWrapAround and/or OnEnd Actions. (See SliderAnimatorDemoScript for details.)<br/>
